## Actual Test Results

### 200 concurrent users:
- Requests/sec: 754
- Avg response time: 265ms
- p95 response time: 792ms
- p99 response time: 1,720ms
- Max response time: 4,514ms
- Error rate: 0%
- CPU usage: 20%
- Memory usage: 15%
- Database connections: 10 idle, 1 active

### 500 concurrent users:
- Similar patterns with increased queue times
- CPU remained at ~20%
- Hardware underutilized but performance degraded

## Root Cause Analysis

**Bottleneck: Single Application Instance Architecture**

The server has spare CPU and memory, but cannot efficiently process 
high concurrency through a single Go instance. Issues:

1. **Single point of processing** - All requests queue through one app
2. **No horizontal scaling** - Can't distribute load
3. **Shared local database** - PostgreSQL on same instance
4. **No caching layer** - Each request hits database

## Breaking Point

Stage 1 begins degrading at **~150 concurrent users**:
- 50 users: Good (<100ms avg)
- 100 users: Acceptable (150-200ms avg)
- 150+ users: Degraded (>300ms, spikes to 4s)
- Hardware underutilized due to architectural limits

## Business Requirement vs Capacity

- **Required capacity**: 500 concurrent users
- **Current capacity**: ~100 users (acceptable performance)
- **Gap**: 400 users (5x increase needed)

## Recommendation

**Stage 1 cannot scale to meet requirements, even with larger instance.**

Moving to t2.large would only help if CPU was the bottleneck. Since 
CPU is at 20%, more CPU won't help. We need architectural changes:

âœ… **Stage 2 Required**: Load Balancer + Multiple App Instances + RDS
- Horizontal scaling (2+ app servers)
- Dedicated RDS database
- Redis for session management
- Can easily handle 500+ concurrent users

**Next Step: Implement Stage 2 Architecture**
